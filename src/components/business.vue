        <p style="font-size: 4.5mm;">What is an investment property?</p>
        <p style="font-size: smaller;">An investment property can be any type of rental property that isn’t your primary residence.
          If you don’t live in a home most of the time, it is an investment property.
          More specifically, any real estate purchased with the intention of earning a return,
          usually via rental income or future resale, is an investment property.
          These can be residential properties, such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings,
          or commercial properties, like restaurants, hotels, and retail space.</p>

       <p>To understand what kind of profits you can expect from your investment property (and to avoid bad investments), you’ll need to do a little math.
         When deciding how much to charge for rent, consider the 1% rule. This simple calculation takes the price you paid for the property,
         plus any maintenance costs, and multiplies it by 1%. The number you get from there is a recommendation for how much rent you can charge.
         (Property price + Repair costs) x 0.01 = Monthly rent
         Using the 1% rule will typically mean that your rental income meets or exceeds your mortgage payments, but it’s just a starting point.
         You should also factor in extra costs (routine maintenance, buffer for emergency repairs, and a property manager) before settling on a rate.
         From there, use the gross rent multiplier (GRM), which is a simple formula that projects how long your rental property will take to pay for itself.
         Property price / Gross annual rental income = Months until property is paid off
         This means if you bought a property for $400,000 and set the rent at $4,000 per month (per the 1% rule), the property would
         theoretically pay for itself in just over eight years.

        <p>While collecting rent checks may sound like an easy way to earn income, being a landlord is a huge responsibility that can require a lot of time and energy.
          Before you purchase an investment property, make sure you understand your state and local landlord-tenant laws. Renters have rights surrounding fair housing,
          lease requirements, security deposits, rent control, timely repairs, eviction rules, and more.
          You also need to keep in mind that maintenance and repairs will need to be done regularly,
          and often very quickly. This means you’ll need to have emergency repair plans, so unexpected issues can be resolved efficiently.
          If you’re pretty handy with a toolbox and have the time to communicate with renters, it might be feasible to handle most things
          on your own and call repair people for maintenance beyond your expertise (just as you would with your primary residence).
          But if you own more than one investment property, don’t live near your investment property, don’t want to do hands-on work,
          or simply don’t have the time to deal with renters on a regular basis, you might want to consider hiring a property management
          company. While their services will cut into your profits, they will take a lot of responsibility off your shoulders.

        <p>Before you can run a background check on a tenant, you must obtain written consent and approval
          from the tenant. It is illegal to run a background check if the renter is unaware you’re doing so.
          You can include a section in your rental application that explicitly asks for their signature and consent.
          To run a background check, you need the renter’s name and social security number. Obtain the necessary
          personal information so you can move forward with the tenant screening process.
          Before you see the results of a background check, it’s smart to have a game plan in mind on what
          you’ll do with the information and how it’ll affect your decision. For example, will teenage misdemeanors
          be a deal-breaker? Or, will you only reject sex offenders, people who’ve been evicted, or hardened criminals?
          To be a fair landlord, you’ll want to know your boundaries and hold everyone accountable to the same standards,
          otherwise, you can face discrimination issues in the future.
          To avoid discrimination and be compliant with the Fair Housing Act, it’s crucial to know the laws and
          understand what you can and cannot do. For example, you cannot run a background check simply because
          of someone’s race or gender. Also, you cannot run a background check and use it as a cover for rejecting
          someone based on sexual orientation or age.</p>

        <p>In real estate, location is king. To understand the areas you might be buying into,
          do a real estate market analysis. This will help you understand the varying fair
          market values of different types of properties, determine how much you can charge
          for rent, and project how well the value of your investment property will appreciate.
          To do this, you’ll need to research your target area. Consider what kind of amenities,
          including public transportation, parks, and proximity to good public schools or offices,
          make your prospective neighborhoods desirable. Then, use multiple sources of reliable
          data to better understand property values in the area. </p>
