        <p>There comes a point in most people's lives, whether it's in your twenties, thirties, fifties or eighties, when you realise you need to make some new friends.
          Maybe you've moved cities, or your close friends moved away, or your main group all went and had kids and now spend their weekends wrangling kids on play equipment at the park.
          And you need friends. Not just to ward off loneliness and provide joy or emotional support, but also friends keep you healthier as you advance into old age, according to studies.</p>
        <p>Rule out drop-ins, like one-time meetups or special events, and look for  activities where the same core people show up every day. Look at the groups on meetup.com where you live and see if there's one that sounds interesting. These are continual groups so it's not likely to be a one time thing you just need to put in the work and get yourself there.  Go to one of the events and begin connecting with people. This is a great way of bonding quickly with a group of like-minded people and getting to spend a lot of time together </p>
        <p>You could meet potential new friends all the time, but you won’t find it as easy to connect with people if you're not showing signs of Interest to them as much as you are trying to be Interesting. Don't make communication one sided, no one wants that.
        Be Interested, Not Interesting</p>

      <md-step id="second" md-label="Contacting Potential Friend">
        <p>So you've met a potential new BFF. Get out of your bubble and do not be shy. Get their contact details and follow up within the week, a simple message to say that you enjoyed meeting them and that you'd like to meet up — give a specific day and activity when you suggest meeting up, rather than being vague</p>
        <p>Go by the rule of three — if a person turns down three invitations, it's time to move on, Don't take the rejection personally. There could be any number of things going on in their life and reasons for them saying no. Perhaps this person has no time or space in their life, in which case, they wouldn't make a great friend anyway.</p>
        <p>Pretty much everyone is secretly scared of getting rejected. So initiate. They'll be relieved and you'll be on your way to those six-to-eight conversations.</p>
      </md-step>

      <md-step id="third" md-label="Be a Regular">
        <p>To have the best shot at friendship, we have to interact with the same person again and again. This means after you hangout with your new friend, don't be shy to mention you'd like to do it again sometime. Be clear on your intentions and you are interested in having them in your life. Whether you're an introvert, extrovert, or anywhere in between, telling someone the details of your life sparks them to share with you, which in turn brings you closer.</p>
        <p>This might feel wrong, as if you're talking too much, being annoying, or making it about you, but if you're known for being reticent, give yourself permission to stretch and grow. The more you share little things about yourself to a person you are spending time with, the easier it is to dig deeper into subjects around them, You'll be more comfortable, and your friend may be too. This is why repetition is so important because you need time to get comfortable talking about yourself and sharing things.</p>
        <p>There's no doubt about it: It's tough to cut through the busyness and ambivalence of life to meet new friend after we've tossed our mortarboards. But don't despair: the stardust that is potential friendship is all around us. Interaction by interaction, disclosure by disclosure, initiation by initiation, we really can make new friends.</p>
