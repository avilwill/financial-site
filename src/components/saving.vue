            <p style="font-size: smaller;"> -----Traditional IRAs aren't the same as Roth IRAs. With Roth IRAs there’s no tax deduction when you make
              contributions, but your withdrawals come out tax-free in retirement. You never pay taxes on your investment
              earnings, as long as you follow the Roth IRA rules.</p>

        What is a Roth IRA?
        A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in
        retirement. Roth IRA rules dictate that as long as you've owned your account for 5 years* and you're age 59½ or
        older, you can withdraw your money when you want to and you won't owe any federal taxes.
        Roth IRAs offer a bit more flexibility than traditional IRAs do. You may withdraw your contributions to a Roth IRA penalty-free at any time for any reason (but you'll be penalized for withdrawing any investment earnings before age 59 ½
        I personally chose to put money into a Roth IRA because the money compounds and grows over time. I work to make
        money and the Roth IRA lets my money work for me and I like the sound of that. The Roth IRA does have a limit to
        how much you can deposit. $6,000 to be exact;
        This is why time is the most important factor when it comes to investing money, That’s also why I, as an 18 year
        old, am off to great start. The Roth IRA is a good way to invest money for retirement because when the time
        comes to pull it out when you no longer work, you get the amount that is in the account, It is tax free when
        pulling it out,
        because it was taxed going in and THEN it was compounded into more money which is why a Roth IRA is a better way
        to go than a traditional in my opinion.

      </md-card-header>

      <md-card-content>
        A traditional IRA is a type of individual retirement account in which individuals can make pre-tax contributions
        and the investments in the account grow tax-deferred.
        In retirement, the owner pays income tax on withdrawals from a traditional IRA. You can add $6,000 per year in
        2020 and 2021 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older),
        even if you’re also contributing to a 401(k) or other workplace savings plan. Generally, you (or your spouse)
        must have earned income to contribute to an IRA.
        You can also add to your IRA by rolling over money from another retirement account.
        How do you know if a Traditional IRA is right for you? There are income limits for Roth IRAs, so if your income is above those limits, then it's a no-brainer: a traditional IRA is the only one for you.
        <p>Roth IRA contributions are limited by income level. In general, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you have taxable income and your modified adjusted gross income is either:</p>

        <p>Less than $194,000 (phasing out from $184,000) if you are married filing jointly.</p>
        <p>Less than $132,000 (phasing out from $117,000) if you are single, head of household, or married filing separately (if you did not live with your spouse at any time during the previous year).</p>
        <p>Less than $10,000 if you're married filing separately and you lived with your spouse at any time during the previous year.</p>

        Mutual funds are a professionally managed portfolio of investments backed by capital from a pool of investors.
        Each fund family has its own stated goals or objectives, as well as risk/reward level. Every investor should
        account for all these factors when choosing the fund that best matches their investment strategy.
        Unlike stocks that trade during the day, the share price of a mutual fund is determined at the end of the
        trading day. That price is known as the net asset value, or NAV. The NAV is the sum total of the value of all
        the holdings within the fund.
        When I decided to have a mutual fund I made the reason for it to be buying a house, so far I have been putting a
        good chunk of my money into it and as it compounds over the next years I will have a good chunk of money for my
        home. The stocks do go up and down, but the stock market always goes up. I invest my money into VTI or FXAIX.

        What is a regular savings account? Regular savings accounts are designed for people wanting to save money every month to build up a savings pot. Because of this you can't deposit a large lump sum.
        When I put money into a savings account it is for the short term savings. Such as a car, or school, maybe rent
        at the end of the month one day. Savings accounts shouldn't be advised to be used to save for long term events
        because of a little thing called inflation. By the time a person retires, if they only ever put retirement money
        into a bank account they would never be able to afford anything in the next 50 years especially since the
        average person is 31 years old before they start saving for retirement, When money is sitting in the bank it
        does not grow it loses value if it is in there for long enough. My savings account I would say is used for
        emergencies, maybe my kia soul whenever the ford focus gives out.

        A bond is simply a loan taken out by a company. Instead of going to a bank, the company gets the money from
        investors who buy its bonds. In exchange for the capital, the company pays an interest coupon, which is the
        annual interest rate paid on a bond expressed as a percentage of the face value. The company pays the interest
        at predetermined intervals (usually annually or semiannually) and returns the principal on the maturity date,
        ending the loan.
        Short-term: Bonds that fall into this category tend to mature within one to three years
        Medium-term: Maturity dates for these types of bonds are normally over ten years
        Long-term: These bonds generally mature over longer periods of time
